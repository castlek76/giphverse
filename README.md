Project 2 - Giphverse
Search engine website that allows users to search for gifs and display them on the screen in a grid. 
User will search for a key word or phrase in the search bar and will be able to press the search button, which will then 
display a grid of gifs within the criteria they searched for. I used .html, .css and .js for this project.
A few areas I think this site could improve are:
1. I couldn't quite figure out the mobile view margins of the screen size. I think I could improve on that
2. The color scheme and title color/style could look better.
3. The blank space inbetween the rows of gifs bugs me but I couldn't quite master that either, I would like to improve that for future.
